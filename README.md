This project is to show how 2 (or more, haha) [BEM](http://bem.info/) blocks can be connected and
share data.<br/>
Project runs currently in Russian.

![Love in terms of BEM](http://www.loveisfan.com/images/love-is-66-1995.jpg)

Every page shows some features of
[i-bem](https://github.com/bem/bem-bl/tree/master/blocks-common/i-bem)
JavaScript block-framework and
equiped with detailed explanation. I describe blocks and pages in Russian
(*.ru.md files) with hope to translate that in English later. Also, I am open to
any contribution: either imporving code or translation work.

List of pages:

params](https://github.com/varya/bem-love/blob/master/desktop.bundles/ask-her-what-music-she-likes/ask-her-what-music-she-likes.ru.md)
