This project is to show how 2 (or more, haha) BEM blocks can be connected and
share data.

Every page shows some features of [i-bem]() JavaScript block-framework and
equiped with detailed explanation. I describe blocks and pages in Russian
(*.ru.md files) with hope to translate that in English later. Also, I am open to
any contribution: either imporving code or translation work.

List of pages:

 * [Frinding a block and reading its params](https://github.com/toivonen/bem-love/blob/master/desktop.bundles/ask-her-what-music-she-likes/ask-her-what-music-she-likes.ru.md)
